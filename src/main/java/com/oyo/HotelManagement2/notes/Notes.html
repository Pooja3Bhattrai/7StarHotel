@JSONIGNORE: To avoid jackson recursion infinite
@JOINCOLUMN , Adds where we wants Foreign Key in a table while Mapping
@JOINCOLUMN: Why we use, :-To avoid IDS in both table and restricted to not create a new Table (ONETOONE AND ONETOMANY)

//CASCADING: If any changes made in one table so automatically change in other table which mapped
example:like if we change made in gmail so it will reflect youtube and google docs as well.

advanagtge cascading:- No need to save in respository


@MANYTOMANY : Thorough this it creates 2 tables (roomId-HotelId) and (HotelId-RoomId)
IN ORDER TO AVOID THAT WE PUT @JOINCOLUMN: SO it creates single table by default their Ids name of Hotel_room-mapping

@JOINCOLUMN(
name = "tableName",

joincolumns = @JOINCOLUMN(name = "hotel_id"),
inverseJoinColumns = @JOINCOLUMN(name = "room_id")
)

ONCE YOU CREATE A TABLE AND MENTION IT AND GIVING REFERENCE AS ABOVE SO IN DATABASE
If any extraa column has to PUT so create another Entity
